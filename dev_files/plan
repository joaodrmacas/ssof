Based on the requirements, here's a recommended high-level approach for analyzing the AST efficiently:

First, build a data flow graph from the AST where:

Nodes represent variables and expressions
Edges represent data flows between them
This only needs to be done once per slice, not per pattern


For each variable in the AST:

Track what values/expressions flow into it
Track where its value flows to
Maintain sanitization state for each flow path


When processing each vulnerability pattern:

Use the prebuilt flow graph to find paths between:

Any sources listed in the pattern
Any uninitialized variables (which count as sources per the spec)
Any sinks listed in the pattern


For each path found:

Check if any sanitizers from the pattern appear along the path
Check for implicit flows if the pattern requires it
Generate the appropriate vulnerability report





This approach is more efficient than checking every source-sink-sanitizer combination individually because:

The flow graph is built once and reused
You can efficiently traverse the graph to find paths
Sanitization state is tracked along with the flows
Implicit flows can be detected by analyzing control dependencies in the graph

Some key things to track in your flow graph:

Direct assignments
Function calls and their arguments
Object property access
Control flow dependencies for implicit flows
Function return values
Sanitizer function applications

The alternative approach of checking every combination would involve redundant AST traversals and make it harder to track complex flow patterns.
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this approach?
